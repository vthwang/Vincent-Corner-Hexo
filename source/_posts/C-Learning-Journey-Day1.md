# Section 2: Essential Fundamentals
## How computer works?
1. CPU have two parts, ALU(Arithmetic Logic Unit) and CU(Control Unit). A computer can perform arithmetic operations like +, -, *, / and logical operations like >, <, =, AND, OR, NOT. 
2. Hard Drive has program files and data files.
3. If you type data into computer, it will put into buffer, not directly use in the program; also the output has buffer, the data will put into output buffer before showing on the screen. So it's the communication point for the device and a programming running inside the memory.
## What is a program?
1. Natural Language -> Programming Language -> Machine Language.
2. When you transform Programming Language to Machine Language, you need Compiler or Interpreter.
## Low-Level v.s. High-Level Language
1. Low-Level Language is the Machine Language, it's the binary system. We can't understand it.
2. Assembly Language is easier than Machine Language, it can be learned, practiced and used for writing the program. However, it's still the Low-Level Language and it's very difficult for learning.
3. High-Level Language: C, C++, Java, Python, C#, VB, VC++....
## Compiler v.s. Interpreter
1. Both do these things.
    - Check Errors - syntax error
    - Convert into Machine Code
2. The third step: Execution. Compiler don't have the responsibility for execution, but Interpreter involved.
3. If we create the first.cpp file, you will get the first.exe file after you compile it. Then, you don't need Compiler anymore, you can execute first.exe as many time as you want.
4. The first difference between them is Interpreter won't create exe file.
5. The second difference between them is Compiler just translate it and it won't execute. However, Interpreter will translate as well as execute.
6. The third difference between them is after Compile compile the file, you can execute whenever you want. However, Interpreter need to translate every time they run. So if n times you are executing then n times translation will be done.
7. Compiling Programs are faster because they're independent as a separate program, but Interpreter Language is easy to write.

I only took some notes of this amazing course for my personal future uses and share my thoughts with my peers. If you like it, you should take the course from Udemy too.
